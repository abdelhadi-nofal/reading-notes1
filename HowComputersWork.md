# How Computers Work ?

*** 

### Computers are everywhere!
### They're in people's pockets, they're in people's cars, people have them on their wrists.
### They might be in your backpack right now.
### As humans, we've always built tools to help us solve problems.
### Tools like a wheelbarrow, a hammer, or a printing press, or a tractor-trailer.
### All of these inventions helped us with manual work.
### Over time, people began to wonder if a machine could be designed and built to help us with the thinking work we do,
### like solving equations or tracking the stars in the sky.
### Rather than moving or manipulating physical things like dirt and stone,these machines would need to be designed to manipulate information.
### As the pioneers of computer science explored how to design a thinking machine,
### they realized that it had to perform four different tasks.
### It would need to take input,store information ,process it and then output the results.
### Now this might sound simple,but these four things are common to all computers.
### That's what makes a computer a computer.
### The earliest computers were made out of wood and metal, with mechanical levers and gears.
### By the 20th century, though, computers started using electrical components.
### These early computers were really large and really slow.
### A computer the size of a room might take hours just to do a basic math problem.
### Computers started out as basic calculators,which was already really awesome at the time, and they were only manipulating numbers back then.
### But now we can use them to talk to each other, we can use them to play games, control robots,and do any crazy thing that you could probably imagine.
### Modern computers look nothing like those clunky old machines ,but they still do these same four things.
### First, we're going to talk about input.
###This is my favorite because what input is
### is the stuff that the world does or that you do that makes the computer do stuff.
### You can tell computers what to do with the keyboard,
### you can tell them what to do with the mouse, the microphone, the camera.
### And now if you're wearing a computer on your wrist, it might listen to your heartbeat ,or in your car, it might be listening to what the car is doing.
### And a touchscreen can actually sense your finger, and it takes that as input on what it's doing.
### All these different inputs give a computer information, which is then stored in memory.
### A computer's processor takes information from memory.
### It manipulates it or changes it using an algorithm, which is just a series of commands.
### And then it sends the processed information back to be stored in memory again.
### This continues until the processed information is ready to be output.
### How a computer outputs information depends on what the computer is designed to do.
### A computer display can show text, photos, videos, or interactive games -- even virtual reality!
### The output of a computer may even include signals to control a robot.
### And, when computers connect over the Internet, the output from one computer becomes the input to another, and vice versa.
### The computers we use today look really different from the earliest thinking machines.
### And who knows what the computers of tomorrow will be like?
### But across all computers, regardless of the different types of technology they use, they're always doing those same four things.
### They take in information, they store it as data,they process it, and then they output the results.
