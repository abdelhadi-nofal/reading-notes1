## How you can benefit from a growth mindset
### The growth mindset can open pathways to more creativity and possibility, and enable the setting of higher goals and more achievement.

### The concept of a growth mindset is a popular topic lately, and I sometimes say to myself “Self, you need to embrace the growth mindset. The growth mindset is cool.”

Why? The aptly named growth mindset helps us grow in whatever we pursue – especially in our work. When we’re growing, we’re more productive. And when I’m productive, I feel better. And you can, too.
