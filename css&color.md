## What is CSS?
**CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets**
**CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media**
**CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once**
**External stylesheets are stored in CSS files**

## Why Use CSS?
**CSS is used to define styles for your web pages, including the design, layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes.**


* CSS treats each HTML e XX lement as if it appears inside its own box and uses rules to indicate how that element should look.
* Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that indicate what these elements should look like).
* Different types of selectors allow you to target your rules at different elements.
* Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties of the element that you want to change, and the values of those properties. For example, the font-family property sets the choice of font, and the value arial specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.
* CSS rules usually appear in a separate document,
although they may appear within an HTML page.

## Color
**The color property allows you to specify the color of text inside an element. You can specify any color in CSS in one of three ways:**
**rgb values :**
**These express colors in terms of how much red, green and**
**blue are used to make it up. For**
**example: rgb(100,100,90)**

**hex codes:**
**These are six-digit codes that**
**represent the amount of red,**
**green and blue in a color,**
**preceded by a pound or hash # sign. For example: #ee3e80**
**color names:**
**There are 147 predefined color**
**names that are recognized**
**by browsers. For example:**
**DarkCyan**
**We look at these three different**
**ways of specifying colors on the**
**next double-page spread.**
**CSS3 has also introduced**
**another way to specify colors**
**called HSLA, which you will**
**meet near the end of this chapter**
**on page 255-256.**
