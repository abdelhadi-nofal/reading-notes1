## Why Study JavaScript?
JavaScript is one of the 3 languages all web developers must learn:

   1. HTML to define the content of web pages

   2. CSS to specify the layout of web pages

   3. JavaScript to program the behavior of web pages

## How Do I Write Script For A Web Page ?

1. It is best to keep JavaScript code in its own JavaScript
file. JavaScript files are text files (like HTML pages and
CSS style sheets), but they have the . j s extension.

2.The HTML <script> element is used in HTML pages
to tell the browser to load the JavaScript file (rather like
the <link> element can be used to load a CSS file).

3.If you view the source code of the page in the browser,
the JavaScript will not have changed the HTML,
because the script works with the model of the web
page that the browser has created.
