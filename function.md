## EXPRESSIONS

### An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking
### there are two types of expressions.

### 1. EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A
### VALUE TO A VARIABLE
### In order for a variable to be useful, it needs to be
### given a value. As you have seen, this is done using
### the assignment operator (the equals sign).
### var color = 'beige';
### The value of co 1 or is now beige.
### When you fi rst declare a variable using the var
### keyword, it is given a special va lue of undefined.
### This will change when you assign a va lue to it.
### Technically, undefined is a data type like a number,
### string, or Boolean.
### 2. EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR
### MORE VALUES TO RETURN A
### SINGLE VALUE
### You can perform operations on any number of
### individual values (see next page) to determine a
### single value. For example:
### var area = 3 * 2;
### The value of area is now 6.
### Here the expression 3 * 2 evaluates into 6. This
### example also uses the assignment operator, so the
### result of the expression 3 * 2 is stored in the variable
### called area.
### Another example where an expression uses two
### values to yield a single value would be where two
### strings are joined to create a single string.

## OPERATORS

Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to
create a single value from one or more values.

## ARITHMETIC OPERATORS

### JavaScript contains the following mathematical
### operators, which you can use with numbers.
### You may remember some from math class.

## ORDER OF EXECUTION

### Several arithmetic operations
### can be performed in one
### expression, but it is important
### to understand how the result
### will be calculated. Multiplication
### and division are performed
### before addition or subtraction.
### This can affect the number that
### you expect to see. To illustrate
### this effect, look at the following
### examples.

## Functions
###  WHAT IS A FUNCTION?
###  Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a
###  specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can
###  reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of st atements).

## Function Parameters
### A function can have one or more parameters, which will be supplied by the calling code and can be used inside a function. JavaScript is a dynamic type scripting language, so a function parameter can have value of any data type.
